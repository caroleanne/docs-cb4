    <p>This installation guide only supports both 32 and 64-bit systems. Windows 7 and 8 are
      supported only for development purposes. See <xref href="install-platforms.dita#topic1634"

      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <p>To install Couchbase Server on Windows, you need to perform following prerequisites: </p>
      <ol id="ol_uvd_nbv_vs">
        <li>Make sure that you have no anti-virus software running on the machine before you start
          the installation process.</li>
        <li>Verify that you have administrator privileges on the machine where you are performing
          the installation.</li>
        <li>By default, on Windows the TCP/IP has default number of ports available for client
          communication. <p>You need to follow the information provided in <xref
              href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610(v=bts.20).aspx" format="html"
              scope="external">Avoiding TCP/IP Port Exhaustion</xref> to adjust the configuration
            and increase the number of available ports.</p></li>
        <li>By default, the Windows system does not provide an adequate number of ephemeral ports
          for Couchbase Server clusters. Without the correct number of open ephemeral ports, you can
          experience errors during rebalance, timeouts on clients, and failed backups. <p>The
            Couchbase Server installer will automatically check for your current port setting and
            adjust it if needed. See <xref href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/196271"
              format="html" scope="external">Microsoft KB-196271</xref>. </p></li>
      </ol>
      <note type="important">Couchbase Server uses the Microsoft C++ redistributable package, which
        is automatically downloaded during installation. However, if another application on your
        machine is already using the package, your installation process can fail. To make sure that
        your installation process completes successfully, shut down all other running applications
        during installation. For Windows 2008, you must upgrade your Windows Server 2008 R2
        installation with Service Pack 1 installed before running Couchbase Server. You can obtain
        Service Pack 1 from <xref

    <section><title>Downloading on Windows Systems</title>
      <p>You can download Couchbase Server directly using the <cmdname>wget.exe</cmdname> command for
        Windows or Powershell scripting. </p>
      <p>The basic syntax of the <cmdname>wget</cmdname> command is:
        <codeblock>$ wget [option]... [url]...</codeblock>For example, the following command downloads a
        version of Couchbase Server and that runs on Windows Server 2012 R2:
        <codeblock>$ wget.exe --no-check-certificate http://packages.couchbase.com/releases/<varname>version</varname>/couchbase-server-enterprise-<varname>version</varname>-windows_amd64.exe </codeblock></p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Interactive Installation</title>
      <p>To install Couchbase Server on Windows using interactive install wizard follow the steps below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In Windows Explorer, locate the downloaded <codeph>Couchbase Server.exe</codeph> file, 
          which typically is located in the default Downloads folder. Double click on the executable file. 
          
          <p>The installer for Windows detects if you need to install any redistributable packages included with 
            Couchbase Server. If these packages are not already on 
            your system, they are automatically installed along with Couchbase Server.</p></li>
        <li>You will be prompted with the Installation Location screen. You can change the location
          where the Couchbase Server application is located, which configures the server location and
          not the location where the persistent data is stored. <p>The installer copies necessary
            files to the system. During the installation process, the installer also verifies that the
            default administration port is not already in use by another application. If the default
            port is unavailable, the installer prompts for a different port to be used for
            administration of Couchbase Server. The installer asks you to set up sufficient ports
            available for the node.</p><p>By default, Microsoft Server will not have an adequate
              number of ephemeral ports, see <xref href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/196271"
                format="html" scope="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article
                196271</xref>:</p><p><image href="picts/wizard-01.png" id="image_u1k_bhv_vs"
                  align="left"/></p></li>
        <li>Click <uicontrol>Yes</uicontrol> to continue. <p>Without a sufficient number of ephemeral
          ports, a Couchbase Server cluster fails during rebalance and backup. Other operations, such as
          client requests, will time-out. If you already changed this setting, you can click No. The
          installer displays this panel to confirm the update. </p><p><image
            href="picts/wizard-02.png" id="image_orp_rhv_vs" align="left"/></p>
        </li>
        <li>After installation, follow the server setup instructions.</li>
      </ol>
      <note type="attention">If the Windows installer hangs on the Computing Space Requirements screen, 
        there is an issue with your setup or installation environment, such as other running applications.
      </note>
      <p>You can implement this workaround to complete the installation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Stop any other browsers and applications that were running when you started installing Couchbase Server.</li>
        <li>Kill the installation process and uninstall the failed setup.</li>
        <li>Delete or rename the temp location under <filepath>C:\Users\[logonuser]\AppData\Temp</filepath>.</li>
        <li>Reboot and try again.</li>
      </ol>    
    </section>
    <section><title>Unattended Installation</title>
      <p>An unattended installation, also referred to as silent or headless installation, uses a
        script to install Couchbase Server.</p>
      <p>To use the unattended installation process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Record your installation settings in the wizard installation. These settings are saved to
          a file, which is used to silently install other nodes of the same version. <ol>
            <li>Open a Command Terminal or Power and start the installation executable with the
              <codeph>/r</codeph> command-line option:
              <codeblock>&gt; couchbase_server_<varname>version</varname>.exe /r /f1your_file_name.iss</codeblock></li>
            <li>Provide your installation options when prompted. Accept an increase in
              <codeph>MaxUserPort</codeph> (recommended). <p>The wizard completes the server
                installation and provides a file with your recorded options at
                <filepath>C:\Windows\your_file_name.iss</filepath>.</p><note type="note">Refer to a
                  sample installation settings file available in the following <xref
                    href="https://gist.github.com/arun-gupta/a3858d6fc0cdfac5afa27f650844619b"
                    format="html" scope="external">gist</xref>.</note></li>
          </ol></li>
        <li>Copy the <codeph>your_file_name.iss</codeph> file into the same directory as the installer
          executable. Run the installer from the command-line using the <codeph>/s</codeph> option:
          <codeblock>&gt; couchbase_server_<varname>version</varname>.exe /s -f1your_file_name.iss</codeblock></li>
        <li>To repeat this process on multiple machines, copy the installation package and the
          <codeph>your_file_name.iss</codeph> file to the same directory on each machine.</li>
      </ol>

  <p><i>condition:</i></p>
  <codeblock>expression</codeblock>

   <p>The WHERE clause serves to filter a stream of variable bindings, retaining those bindings for
      which the truth value of the WHERE clause is TRUE and discarding the bindings for which this
      truth value is FALSE.</p>
  <p>Example</p>

<codeblock>SELECT * FROM tutorial WHERE fname = 'Ian'</codeblock>
